    description: `Ever since high school, I have been interested in computer and everything connected with it, from hardware
    to computer games. I was curious about html and css, which allowed me to do magic in the browser. For the
    first time in practice, I faced the front-end, when I worked as a system administrator in a private
    clinic. The head asked me to correct the clinic's website, namely to add a slider, update the doctors
    photos and add a section. I spent a couple of days on Google and figured it out, so I completed my first
    order. The difficulty turned out to be that the site engine was self-written, but I found out about it
    later, when I got acquainted with the popular cms: joomla, wordpress and MODX. As a result of the task, I
    had a great desire to develop in this direction.`,
